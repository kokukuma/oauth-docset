<span class="h2"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/1.%20%20Introduction"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-1" id="section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document describes the use cases that have been discussed on the
   oauth WG mailing list and introduced by the Internet Drafts submitted
   to the group.  The selected use cases illustrate the use of the OAuth
   flows by the clients of the various profiles and types.  The document
   also includes those cases that are not directly supported by the
   OAuth 2.0 [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>], but were considered during its
   development.  The document provides a list of the requirements
   derived from the use cases.  The use cases supported by OAuth 2.0 are
   indicated.

   The document's objective is to help with understanding of the OAuth
   2.0 protocol design.

   The following section provides the abbreviated descriptions of the
   use cases.


<span class="h2"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/2.%20%20OAuth%20use%20cases"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-2" id="section-2">2</a>.  OAuth use cases</span>

   This section describes the use cases that have been discussed by the
   oauth WG.

<span class="h3"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/2.1.%20%20Web%20server"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-2.1" id="section-2.1">2.1</a>.  Web server</span>

   Description:

   Alice accesses an application running on a web server at
   www.printphotos.example and instructs it to print her photographs
   that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.  The application
   at www.printphotos.example receives Alice's authorization for
   accessing her photographs without learning her authentication
   credentials with www.storephotos.example.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example to enable
      authentication

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example has established
      authentication credentials with the application at
      www.storephotos.example

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application
   www.printphotos.example receiving an authorization code from

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft               OAuth Use Cases                October 2012</span>


   www.storephotos.example.  The code is bound to the application at
   www.printphotos.example and to the callback URL supplied by the
   application.  The application at www.printphotos.example uses the
   authorization code for obtaining an access token from
   www.storephotos.example.  The application at www.storephotos.example
   issues an access token after authenticating the application at
   www.printphotos.example and validating the authorization code that it
   has submitted.  The application at www.printphotos.example uses the
   access token for getting access to Alice's photographs at
   www.storephotos.example.

   Note: When an access token expires, the service at
   www.printphotos.example needs to repeat the OAuth procedure for
   getting Alice's authorization to access her photographs at
   www.storephotos.example.  Alternatively, if Alice wants to grant the
   application a long lasting access to her resources at
   www.storephotos.example, the authorization server associated with
   www.storephotos.example may issue the long-living tokens.  Those
   tokens can be exchanged for short-living access tokens required to
   access www.storephotos.example.

   Requirements:

   o  The server www.printphotos.example, which hosts an OAuth client,
      must be capable of issuing the HTTP redirect requests to Alice's
      user agent - a browser

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example must be able to
      authenticate Alice.  The authentication method is not in the OAuth
      scope

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example must obtain Alice's
      authorization of the access to her photos by
      www.printphotos.example

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example may identify to Alice the
      scope of access that www.printphotos.example has requested while
      asking for Alice's authorization

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example must be able to
      authenticate the application at www.printphotos.example and
      validate the authorization code before issuing an access token.
      The OAuth 2.0 protocol [<a href="#ref-I-D.ietf-oauth-v2">I-D.ietf-oauth-v2</a>] specifies one
      authentication method that <em>MAY</em> be used for such authentication -
      Client Password Authentication.

   o  Application at www.printphotos.example must provide a callback URL
      to the application at www.storephotos.example (note: the URL can

      be pre-registered with www.storephotos.example)

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example is required to maintain a
      record that associates the authorization code with the application
      at www.printphotos.example and the callback URL provided by the
      application

   o  Access tokens are bearer's tokens (they are not associated with a
      specific application, such as www.printphotos.example) and should
      have a short lifespan

   o  Application at www.storephotos.example must invalidate the
      authorization code after its first use

   o  Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure
      (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required.
      (Alice's authentication to www.storephotos.example is not in the

   Description:

   Alice has on her computer a gaming application.  She keeps her scores
   in a database of a social site at www.fun.example.  In order to
   upload Alice's scores, the application gets access to the database
   with her authorization.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice uses a gaming application implemented in a scripting
      language (e.g., JavaScript) that runs in her browser and uses
      OAuth for accessing a social site at www.fun.example

   o  There is no a web site supporting this application and capable of
      handling the OAuth flow, so the gaming application needs to update
      the database itself

   o  The application is registered with the social site at
      www.fun.example and has an identifier

   o  Alice has registered with www.fun.example for identification and
      authentication

   o  An auxiliary web server at www.help.example is reachable by
      Alice's browser and capable of providing a script that extracts an
      access token from an URL's fragment

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in Alice's browser receiving an access
   token.  The access token is received from www.fun.example as a
   fragment of a redirection URL of an auxiliary web server
   www.help.example.  Alice's browser follows the redirection, but
   retains the fragment.  From the auxiliary web server at
   www.help.example Alice's browser downloads a script that extracts
   access token from the fragment and makes it available to the gaming
   application.  The application uses the access token to gain access to
   Alice's data at www.fun.example.

   Requirements:

   o  Registration of the application running in the Alice's browser
      with the application running on www.fun.example is required for
      identification

   o  Alice's authentication with www.fun.example is required

   o  Application running at www.fun.example must be able to describe to
      Alice the request made by the gaming application running on her
      computer and obtain Alice's authorization for or denial of the
      requested access

   o  After obtaining Alice's authorization the application running at
      www.fun.example must respond with an access token and redirect
      Alice's browser to a web server (e.g., www.help.example) that is
      capable of retrieving an access token from an URL

   Description:

   Alice wants to upload (or download) her photographs to (or from)
   storephotos.example using her smartphone.  She downloads and installs
   a photo app on her smartphone.  In order to enable the app to access
   her photographs, Alice needs to authorize the app to access the web
   site on her behalf.  The authorization shall be valid for a prolonged
   duration (e.g. several months), so that Alice does not need to
   authenticate and authorize access on every execution of the app.  It
   shall be possible to withdraw the app's authorization both on the

   smartphone as well as on the site storephotos.example.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has installed a (native) photo app application on her
      smartphone

   o  The installed application is registered with the social site at
      storephotos.example and has an identifier

   o  Alice holds an account with storephotos.example

   o  Authentication and authorization shall be performed in an
      interactive, browser-based process.  The smartphone's browser is
      used for authenticating Alice and for enabling her to authorize
      the request by the Mobile App

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in Alice's app receiving the access
   and refresh tokens.  The app obtains the tokens by utilizing the
   Authorization Code flow.  The application uses the access token to
   gain access to Alice's data at storephotos.example.  The refresh
   tokens are persistently stored on the device for use in subsequent
   app executions.  If a refresh token exists on app startup, the app
   directly uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

   Requirements:

   o  Alice's authentication with storephotos.example is required

   o  Registration of the application running on Alice's smartphone is
      required for identification and registration and may be carried
      out on a per installation base

   o  The application at storephotos.example provides a capability to
      view and delete the apps' authorizations.  This implies that the
      different installations of the same app on the different devices
      can be distinguished (e.g., by a device name or a telephone
      number)

   o  The app must provide Alice an option to logout.  The logout must
      result in revocation of the refresh tokens on the authorization
      server

   Note: OAuth 2.0 supports this use case

   Description:

   Alice has installed on her computer a gaming application (e.g.,
   running as native code or as a widget).  At some point she wants to
   play the next level of the game and needs to purchase an access to
   the advanced version of the game from her service provider at
   www.sp.example.  With Alice's authorization the application accesses
   her account at www.sp.example and enables her to make the payment.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered and has an account with her service provider
      at www.sp.example

   o  The application is registered with the service provider at
      www.sp.example.  This enables the server provider to provide Alice
      with all necessary information about the gaming application
      (including the information about the purchasing price)

   o  Alice has a Web user-agent (e.g., a browser or a widget runtime)
      installed on her computer

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the gaming application invoking the
   user browser and directing it to the authorization server of the
   service provider.  The HTTP message includes information about the
   gaming application's request to access Alice's account.  The
   authorization server presents to Alice the authentication and
   authorization interfaces.  The authorization interface shows Alice
   the information about the application's request including the
   requested charge to her account.  After Alice successfully
   authenticates and authorizes the request, the authorization server
   enables Alice to save the transaction details including the
   authorization code issued for the gaming application.  Then the
   authorization server redirects Alice's browser to a custom scheme URI
   (registered with the operating system).  This redirection request
   contains a one-time authorization code and invokes a special
   application that is able to extract the authorization code and
   present it to the gaming application.  The gaming application
   presents the authorization code to the authorization server and
   exchanges it for a one-time access token.  The gaming application
   then uses the access token to get access to Alice's account and post
   the charges at www.sp.example.

   Requirements:

   Note: The focus is on the requirements that are specific to this use
   case.  The requirements that are common to the native applications
   are listed in the preceding use case.

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must be able to provide Alice with information
      about the access request that the gaming application has made
      (including the amount that is to be charged to her account with
      the service provider and the purpose for the charge) over a secure
      transport

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must be able to obtain Alice's authorization
      decision on the request over a secure transport

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must be able to generate on demand a one-time
      authorization code and a one-time access token according to the
      scope authorized by Alice

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must be able to call back to the gaming application
      with the authorization result over a secure transport

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must enable the gaming application to exchange an
      authorization code for an access token over a secure transport

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must verify the authorization code and invalidate
      it after its first use

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must enable Alice to save the details of the
      requested transaction, including the authorization code

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must keep a record linking the requested
      transaction with the authorization code and the respective access
      token

   o  An authorization server associated with the server at
      www.sp.example must enable the resource server www.sp.example to
      obtain the transaction information that is linked to the issued
      access token

   o  Resource server at www.sp.example must verify access token and
      invalidate it after its first use

   o  A resource server at www.sp.example must enable the gaming
      application to post charges to Alice's account according to the
      access token presented over a secure transport

   o  The gaming application must provide a custom scheme URI to the
      authorization server associated with www.sp.example (note: it can
      be preregistered with the authorization server)

   o  Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure
      (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required.
      (Alice's authentication to www.sp.example is not in the OAuth
      scope)

   Description:

   Alice has a device, such as a gaming console, that does not support
   an easy data-entry method.  She also has access to a computer with a
   browser.  The application running on the Alice's device gets
   authorized access to a protected resource (e.g., photographs) stored
   on a server at www.storephotos.example

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice uses a gaming console, which does not have an easy data-
      entry method, for accessing her photographs at
      www.storephotos.example

   o  Alice is able to connect to www.storephotos.example using a
      computer that runs a browser

   o  Auhtorization server associated with www.storephotos.example is
      able to generate an authorization code that is suitable for
      reading and writing by a human (e.g., an alphanumeric string that
      is not too long)

   o  The gaming device supports input of the characters that can be
      found in an authorization code

   o  Alice has registered with the authorization server associated with
      www.storephotos.example for identification and authentication

   o  Alice, interacting with an authorization server associated with
      www.storephotos.example, authorizes access to her photographs by
      her gaming console.  She uses her browser-equipped computer for
      OAuth authorization

   o  The authorization server associated with www.storephotos.example
      responds to Alice's authorization by displaying an authorization
      code in her browser's window

   o  Alice enters the displayed code into an input field on the gaming
      console

   o  The gaming console exchanges with the authorization server the
      authorization code for an access token

   o  Alice's gaming console uses the access token to access the
      photographs on www.storephotos.example

   Requirements:

   o  Alice's authentication with the authorization server is required

   o  Alice is required to perform authorization of her gaming console
      by interacting with the authorization server associated with
      www.storephotos.example.  To that end she has to direct her
      browser to the authorization server

   o  After authorizing the access and getting an authorization code
      displayed in her browser, Alice has to enter the displayed code
      into an input field on the gaming console

   o  The gaming console should be able to exchange the authorization
      code for an access token through interaction with the
      authorization server associated with www.storephotos.example

   o  The URL of the authorization server and the authorization code
      must be suitable for manual entry

   o  The authorization code must be composed of the characters that are
      appropriate for input to the gaming console

   o  Because the authorization code is relatively short and its
      character set is limited, the code's lifetime should be configured
      appropriately

   the same authorization server, so the application at
   www.communicator.example can receive a single authorization from
   Alice for getting access to these three services on her behalf at
   once.
   The authorization server needs to issue different access tokens for
   the involved services due to security and privacy policy.  One
   typical reason is the use of the symmetric secrets for signing self-
   contained access tokens.  In this use case, using a particular token
   for more than a single service introduces a security risk.

   Note: This use case is especially useful for native applications
   since a web browser needs to be launched only once.

   Description:

   Alice accesses a social site on a web server at www.social.example.
   Her browser loads a VoIP applet that enables her to make a VoIP call
   using her SIP server at www.sipservice.example.  The application at
   www.social.example gets Alice's authorization to use her account with
   www.sipservice.example without learning her authentication
   credentials with www.sipservice.example.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.sipservice.example for
      authentication

   o  The application at www.social.example has established
      authentication credentials with the application at
      www.sipservice.example

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application at
   www.social.example receiving access token from www.sipservice.example
   with Alice's authorization.

   Requirements:

   o  The server at www.social.example must be able to redirect Alice's
      browser to www.sipservice.example

   o  The application running at www.sipservice.example must be capable
      of authenticating Alice and obtaining her authorization of a
      request from www.social.example

   o  The server at www.sipservice.example must be able to redirect
      Alice's browser back to www.social.example

   o  The application at www.social.example must be able to translate
      the messages of the Alice's VoIP applet into SIP and RTP messages

   o  The application at www.social.example must be able to add the
      access token to the SIP requests that it sends to
      www.sipservice.example

   o  Application at www.sipservice.example must be able to authenticate
      the application at www.social.example and validate the access
      token

   o  Alice's manual involvement in the OAuth authorization procedure
      (e.g., entering an URL or a password) should not be required.
      (Alice's authentication to www.sipservice.example is not in the

   Description:

   Alice manages all her personal health records in her personal health
   data store at a server at www.myhealth.example, which manages
   authorization of access to Alice's participating health systems.
   Alice's Primary Care Physician (PCP), which has a Web site at
   www.pcp.example, recommends her to see a sleep specialist
   (www.sleepwell.example).  Alice arrives at the sleep specialist's
   office and authorizes it to access her basic health data at her PCP's
   web site.  The application at www.pcp.example verifies that Alice has
   authorized www.sleepwell.example to access her health data as well as
   enforces that www.sleepwell.example is the only application that can
   retrieve that data with that specific authorization.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has a personal health data store that allows for discovery
      of her participating health systems (e.g. psychiatrist, sleep
      specialist, PCP, orthodontist, ophthalmologist, etc)

   o  The application at www.myhealth.example manages authorization of
      access to Alice's participating health systems

   o  The application at www.myhealth.example can issue authorization
      tokens understood by Alice's participating health systems

   o  The application at www.pcp.example stores Alice's basic health and
      prescription records

   o  The application at www.sleepwell.com stores results of Alice's
      sleep tests

   Post-conditions:

   o  A successful procedure results in just the information that Alice
      authorized being transferred from the Primary Care Physician
      (www.pcp.example) to the sleep specialist (www.sleepwell.example)

   o  The transfer of health data only occurs if the application at
      www.pcp.example can verify that www.sleepwell.example is the party
      requesting access and that the authorization token presented by
      www.sleepwell.example is issued by the application at
      www.myhealth.example with a restricted audience of
      www.sleepwell.example

   Requirements:

   o  The application at www.sleepwell.example interacting with
      www.myhealth.example must be able to discover the location of the
      PCP system (e.g., XRD discovery)

   o  The application at www.sleepwell.example must be capable of
      requesting Alice's authorization of access to the application at
      www.pcp.example for the purpose of retrieving basic health data
      (e.g. date-of-birth, weight, height, etc).  The mechanism Alice
      uses to authorize this access is out of scope for this use case

   o  The application at www.myhealth.example must be capable of issuing
      a token bound to www.sleepwell.example for access to the
      application at www.pcp.example.  Note that a signed token (JWT)
      can be used to prove who issued the token

   o  The application at www.sleepwell.example must be capable of
      issuing a request (which includes the token issued by
      www.myhealth.example) to the application at www.pcp.example

   o  The application at www.sleepwell.example must sign the request
      before sending it to www.pcp.example

   Description:

   Alice accesses an application running on a web server at
   www.printphotos.example and instructs it to print her photographs
   that are stored on a server www.storephotos.example.  The application
   at www.printphotos.example, which does not have a shared secret with
   www.storephotos.example, receives Alice's authorization for accessing
   her photographs without learning her authentication credentials with
   www.storephotos.example.

   Pre-conditions:

   o  Alice has registered with www.storephotos.example to enable
      authentication

   o  The application at www.printphotos.example has a private and a
      matching public keys

   Post-conditions:

   A successful procedure results in the application at
